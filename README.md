# tic-tac-toe-game
A Tic Tac Toe game in Python is a simple yet popular project that helps beginners grasp fundamental programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and functions.
This game runs in the terminal or command line interface. Players interact with the game by entering numbers corresponding to their desired grid positions. The interface provides feedback after each move and declares the winner or announces a draw.
This project is a great way to practice basic programming concepts and can be expanded with more features such as a computer opponent or a graphical user interface (GUI)!
